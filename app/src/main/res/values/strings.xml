    <string name="how_to_play_desc">Minesweeper is a fun and easy game where the objective is to try and clear
    the game board of all empty spaces without hitting any mines. To begin the game, you simply click anywhere on
    the board and a space will automatically free up. Each number resembles the amount of mines that are around its
    area. Imagine that a square box surrounds each number. The number displayed showcases the amount of mines in that
    box. In order to keep track of where you think mines are located, you can place down a red flag to remind yourself
    not to tap there. But if you hit a mine, it\'s game over. Additionally, if power-ups are enabled in settings, you can
    use features like 50/50 to clear up half the board and second chance to continue the game even after hitting a mine.
    These power-ups will appear randomly across the board.</string>
